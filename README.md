# Video Assistant Referee (VAR)

This repository contains C++ implementation for computing the homography matrix using a combination of ellipse-circle correspondence and three additional points. Sampling the ellipse requires a minimum number of four points, but the provided demo utilizes seven points for clarity. The number of sampling points is currently hardcoded and can be adjusted accordingly.

## Compilation and run

```bash
./c.sh 
./a
```
