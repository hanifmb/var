# Video Assistant Referee (VAR)

C++ implementation for computing the homography matrix using a combination of ellipse-circle correspondence and three additional points. Sampling the ellipse requires a minimum number of seven points for reliable estimation. The number of sampling points is currently hardcoded and can be adjusted accordingly.

## Compilation and run
